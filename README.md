# Description
This is a tutorial game I followed from a youtube channel known as Brackeys
[Tutorial You Can Follow To Build Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=451s)
## All credit goes to him, not me.
I just wanted to store this project somewhere I could share it and use version control.
### Download
You can download this project and open it in Godot. However, you can also just download the exe and cpk file if you have a Windows machine. Just make sure you run the exe in the same directory as the cpk file, otherwise you will get an error when trying to launch the game.
